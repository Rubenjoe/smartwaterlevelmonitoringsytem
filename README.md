# 💧 Smart Water Level Monitoring and Pump Control

### 📘 Overview  
This project monitors the water level in a tank using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** and automatically controls a **12 V DC pump** through a **relay module**. The system runs on a **NodeMCU ESP8266** with the **Blynk IoT platform**, enabling real-time monitoring and remote control via smartphone.

### ⚙️ Components Used  
- NodeMCU ESP8266  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- 5 V Dual-Channel Relay Module (with Optocoupler)  
- 12 V DC Water Pump  
- 12 V Power Supply  
- Jumper Wires and Breadboard

### 🧠 Working Principle  
1. The HC-SR04 emits an ultrasonic pulse via TRIG from the NodeMCU.  
2. The echo is received and the NodeMCU measures the time duration → converts to distance in cm.  
3. The distance is mapped to a percentage level (0 % = empty, 100 % = full) based on the calibrated min/max distances.  
4. In **Auto mode**, if water level falls below a threshold (e.g., 20 %), the pump is turned ON; when it rises above a higher threshold (e.g., 80 %), the pump is turned OFF.  
5. In **Manual mode**, the user can control the pump via the Blynk button. The pump status LED reflects whether the pump is running.
